Rather, I had been using Jacob Mattingley&#39;s much simpler <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/using.html">Jemdoc</a> package in Python with Wonseok Shin&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/wsshin/jemdoc_mathjax">neat extension</a> for MathJax support.</p> <p>I liked that Jemdoc&#43;Mathjax was simple to use and didn&#39;t require a lot of web-dev skills to get going. That&#39;s how I got the idea of doing something similar in Julia, hopefully improving on the few things I didn&#39;t like such as the lack of support for live-rendering preview or the speed of page generation.</p> <p>That being said, if you just want a blogging generator mostly for text and pictures, then JuDoc may not the tool for you. If you want to host a technical blog with maths, code blocks, and would like some easy and reproducible control over elements, then JuDoc could help you &#40;feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/JuDoc.jl/issues/new">open an issue</a> to see if JuDoc is right for you&#41;.</p> <h3 id=why_not_pandoc ><a href="/JuDocWeb/pub/why-o-why.html#why_not_pandoc">Why not Pandoc?</a></h3> <p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a very different beast. JuDoc&#39;s aim was never to provide a seamless LaTeX to HTML conversion &#40;which Pandoc does&#41;. Rather, JuDoc supports standard markdown <strong>and</strong> the definition of commands following a LaTeX-like syntax. These commands can make the use of repeated elements in your website significantly easier to maintain.</p> <p>Further, Pandoc does not deal with the generation of a full website with things like live-previews, code evaluation etc.</p> <h3 id=why_write_your_own_markdown_parser ><a href="/JuDocWeb/pub/why-o-why.html#why_write_your_own_markdown_parser">Why write your own markdown parser?</a></h3> <p>I suspect many computer scientists or similar types will agree that <em>parsing</em> is an interesting topic. JuDoc provided an incentive to think hard about how to parse extended markdown efficiently and while I&#39;d definitely not dare to say that the parser is very good, it does a decent job and I learned a lot coding it.</p> <p>In particular, processing LaTeX-like commands which can be re-defined and should be resolved recursively proved pretty interesting. </p> <p>Initially JuDoc was heavily reliant upon the <code>Markdown</code> stdlib which can convert markdown to HTML but over time this changed as JuDoc gained the capacity to parse a broader set of Markdown as well as extensions.</p> <h3 id=did_you_know ><a href="/JuDocWeb/pub/why-o-why.html#did_you_know">Did you know?</a></h3> <p>Judoc is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judoc">fairly obscure saint</a> &#40;I definitely did not know that before registering the package... but it did inspire me for the logo&#41;. <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Thibaut Lienart.
