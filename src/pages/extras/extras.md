# Extras

In this section of the manual, the assumption is that you already have a fairly good idea of how JuDoc works so that basic explanations are skipped (refer to the rest of the  manual for help).

The aim is to show how JuDoc can work with other useful libraries to add  functionalities to  your website.

As usual, these examples are just meant to show what can be done, not the best way to do it, feel free to  modify  the  examples at will!
Also, if you come up with other nice ways of extending JuDoc, don't hesitate to make a suggestion for an example to  be added here.
